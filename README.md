Snapshot manager for ZFS

This is a work in progress project I whipped up in Lazarus to manage ZFS snapshots.

# What works so far:
Creating snapshots
Deleting snapshots
Browsing snapshots
Scheduling snapshots
All settings functional and saved in config file

# What doesn't work:
Creating cron jobs for running scheduled snapshots
