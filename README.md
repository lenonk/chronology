Snapshot manager for ZFS

This is a work in progress project I whipped up in Lazarus to manage ZFS snapshots.

# What works so far:
Creating snapshots<br>
Deleting snapshots<br>
Browsing snapshots<br>
Scheduling snapshots<br>
All settings functional and saved in config file<br>

# What doesn't work:
Creating cron jobs for running scheduled snapshots<br>
